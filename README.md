# combinators-presentation

(Archived) Presentation on Combinatory Logic at the EPFL PL Seminar 2024-06-11

The presentation itself is archived as
[presentation/combinatory-logic.pdf](presentation/combinatory-logic.pdf). The
LaTeX sources are present alongside.

[trampoline-benchmarks](https://github.com/sankalpgambhir/trampoline-benchmarks)
is included as a submodule as it serves as relevant motivation and the source
for some data and code in the presentation.

Some code unique to this presentation, e.g. a manual translation of the small
Haskell `double` program to C is present in [code/](code/).
